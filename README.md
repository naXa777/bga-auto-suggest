# bga-auto-suggest
A user script that will automatically suggest players to your table on boardgamearena.com

On boardgamearena.com, players will often not join your table unless they are suggested to that table. BGA also limits you to 1 suggestion every 5 seconds, so manually suggesting players to your table can be a tedious process. insectman from the Perudo community wrote an proof of concept script to automate this process (https://pastebin.com/4eW7ugTs). I rewrote his script to work as a user script on greasemonkey or tampermonkey while taking away dependencies and stuff. 

You can adjust the minimum Elo, add people to the white list, or add people to a blacklist to your liking if you wish to.
